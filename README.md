🎓 **Cornell MPS in Information Science** | 📊 **UC San Diego B.S. in Data Science & Economics**

I turn coffee ☕ into machine learning pipelines and chaotic JSON into neatly labeled dashboards. I speak fluent Python 🐍, a bit of SQL, and occasionally scream at my models when they output `"NoneType"`.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On (besides debugging)

- 🤖 Built an LLM evaluation framework using 21+ metrics (aka: gave GPT homework and graded it)
- 🛒 NLP pipeline for e-commerce chats — because customer support deserves an upgrade
- 🕵️‍♂️ Built a classifier to detect digital transformation... and my own sleep deprivation

## 💬 Fun Facts

- 🏀 I analyze data by day and play pick-up basketball like it’s a Kaggle comp at night
- 🔄 I once wrote a recursive function... and then recursively regretted it
- 📉 My love life has fewer parameters than my models, but just as many hyperparameters
