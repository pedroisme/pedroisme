🎓 **Master’s in Information Science @ Cornell**  
📊 **B.S. in Data Science & Economics @ UC San Diego**

I’m a data and AI engineer with a focus on building intelligent systems that blend NLP, machine learning, and scalable data pipelines. I thrive at the intersection of product impact and model performance — translating noisy, unstructured data into clear insights and robust models.
